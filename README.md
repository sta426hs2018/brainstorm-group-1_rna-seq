## Applications

#### General info
* RNA splicing patterns: How are genes actually transcribed and subsequently translated into proteins?
* Gene discovery: Presence of unique stretches of DNA might reveal previously undiscovered genes.
* Gene expression profiling: Expression levels of known genes can be inferred by looking at relative amounts of RNA expression.
* Profiling of miRNAs implicated in cancer
* Targeted cancer gene profiling
