## RNAseq introduction

## Why do we sequence RNA? 
Since DNA sequence is identical (in theory) throughout one individual organism, what makes the various tissue/cell types is the usage of the DNA. The first step of using the DNA is transcription that generates RNA. The transcriptome conveys biological information that reflects the function of a cell/tissue. Thus, profiling RNA could help us understand how a cell/tissue work and probe the state of a cell/tissue.
## Applications
(1) Differentiation gene expression analysis
(2) Explore novel RNA expression, eg. non-coding RNA, micro RNA, piwi RNA etc.
(3) Explore the RNA post-transcription processing, eg. splicing, etc.
## Statistics
Negative binominal GLM, Cox-Reid Approximate Conditional Variance, 

#### General info
* RNA splicing patterns: How are genes actually transcribed and subsequently translated into proteins?
* Gene discovery: Presence of unique stretches of DNA might reveal previously undiscovered genes.
* Gene expression profiling: Expression levels of known genes can be inferred by looking at relative amounts of RNA expression.
* Profiling of miRNAs implicated in cancer
* Targeted cancer gene profiling

## Methodology

The first step is to prepare the cDNA library. 

1. RNA isolation / extraction - This can be done using liquid nitrogen and using a mortar and pestle to break it apart. It is essential to maintain the integrity of the RNA in this step.
2. RNA selection - RNA can be kept as is, filtered, depleted or filtered for RNA that binds to specific sequences.
3. cDNA synthesis - The RNA is now reverse transcribed to cDNA i.e. creating a double stranded DNA from an RNA template
