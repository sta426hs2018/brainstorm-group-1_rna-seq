## Why do we sequence RNA? 
Since DNA sequence is identical (in theory) throughout one individual organism, what makes the various tissue/cell types is the usage of the DNA. The first step of using the DNA is transcription that generates RNA. The transcriptome conveys biological information that reflects the function of a cell/tissue. Thus, profiling RNA could help us understand how a cell/tissue work and probe the state of a cell/tissue.
## Applications

#### General info
* RNA splicing patterns: How are genes actually transcribed and subsequently translated into proteins?
* Gene discovery: Presence of unique stretches of DNA might reveal previously undiscovered genes.
* Gene expression profiling: Expression levels of known genes can be inferred by looking at relative amounts of RNA expression.
* Profiling of miRNAs implicated in cancer
* Targeted cancer gene profiling
